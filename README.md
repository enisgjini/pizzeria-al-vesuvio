Pizzeria Al Vesuvio

2. Project Description

Pizzeria "Al Vesuvio" is a pizzeria which operates in the state of Italy.
This website solves the problem of digitalization of the menu of this pizzeria.
Making it more readable as well as more communicative with the person looking at the menu.

The reason why I used the PHP programming language was that it gave me more productive space and environment for the development of this website.
